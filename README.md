# PWA Examples

fork from `mdn`

Examples for progressive web apps.

An example set up to show how Add to home screen (A2HS) works. [See it live here](https://realleonardo.github.io/pwa-example/). This includes an icon and [manifest file](manifest.webmanifest) for allowing the app to be added to home screen, and a [simple service worker](sw.js) for making the site work offline.
